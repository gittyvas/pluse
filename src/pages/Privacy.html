                After account creation, you will be asked to connect external accounts like email, calendar, and Twitter. You'll need to connect at least one account for Pulse to be useful, but adding additional accounts is optional. Connected accounts are only used to build a holistic view of your network; each has special protections to ensure Pulse only uses data that is necessary for the product, and that sensitive fields are protected.

                    Connected messaging accounts are only used to create contacts based on the people you’ve texted. Message data is never read directly—Pulse computes aggregate statistics like how often you’ve texted someone, but never accesses message text.

                <p class="mb-4">
                    Pulse only references contacts to use the name you have stored for a phone number. That name is only saved to your account, and is never shared.

                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">What does Pulse do with full disk access?</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    Recent versions of macOS restrict access to iMessage / WhatsApp data, so the only way for Pulse to integrate with iMessage is to have full disk access — there’s no more restrictive access we can ask for, but if this ever changes we’ll modify the integration accordingly. Full disk access is only used to identify who you’ve texted in accordance with this integration, and Pulse uses read-only access.

This telemetry is limited to high-level product usage and never includes any sensitive contact data like notes or contact information.
