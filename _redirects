    # --- SPA Fallback for Client-Side Routing ---
    # This rule redirects all requests that don't match a file or directory
    # to your index.html, allowing your client-side router (React Router) to handle them.
    # The '200' status code tells the browser that the request was successful,
    # even though it's serving the same index.html for different paths.
    /* /index.html   200

    # --- API Proxy to Backend ---
    # This rule proxies requests from your frontend's /api path to your live backend.
    # For example, a request from your frontend to `https://pluse.gitthit.com.ng/api/notes`
    # will be transparently sent by Netlify to `https://pluse-crm.onrender.com/api/notes`.
    # This helps avoid CORS issues and keeps your frontend code cleaner.
    /api/* https://pluse-crm.onrender.com/api/:splat    200
